## Development

  - See [package.json](./package.json) for complete list of preconfigured test commands
  - All component tests: `npm run test:jest`
  - All e2e tests: `npm run test:playwright`
  - All tests (e2e and component): `npm run test`

### Shadcn

See the [docs](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs) for Shadcn

This is a UI library that works nicely with Tailwind. They don't supply prebuilt components, but instead let us generate our own components using their CLI tool and our own config. I.e., `npx shadcn@latest add button` will create a button component.

Ideally we do not need to modify any code that is generated by Shadcn. This would make it difficult to regenerate UI components if we want to modify Shadcn config in a way. Instead we want to modify Shadcn config and Tailwind variables that Shadcn is using to style components (e.g., `--color-background`, `--color-foreground`, `--color-primary`, `--color-primary-foreground`). See the full list of variables [here](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/theming)

To keep a consistent color scheme we will try to use these Shadcn Tailwind variable wherever possible.
